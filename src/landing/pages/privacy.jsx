          This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Agile Waterfall Inc. ("Agile Waterfall", "we", "us" or "our") collects,

          may provide through the Flooq website (flooq.io) and editor (editor.flooq.io) or in the course of purchasing any Flooq products
          (collectively, "Website"). The Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information
          and how you can access and update this information.
          This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you make a purchase through the Website.
          Currently this is limited to your email address, which is required for you to be able to login to the Website and access any purchased Flooq products.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Collection of non-personal information</h2>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends.
          This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version,
          language preferences, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics.

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          All purchases made through the Website are processed by a third party payment processor, Stripe (<a className="text-blue-500" href="https://stripe.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">stripe.com</a>).
          Stripe may ask you for personal and/or non-personal information, such as your name, address, email address, credit card information, or other Personal Information.
          Stripe has a privacy policy (<a className="text-blue-500" href="https://stripe.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer">stripe.com/privacy</a>) that describes their collection and use of personal information.
          Flooq does not control Stripe or its collection or use of information. Any questions or concerns about Stripe's practices should be directed to Stripe.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Stripe provides us with certain non-personal information relating to purchases made by visitors to the Website.
          The non-personal information may include details of the purchase such as the date, amount paid, and product purchased.
          The non-personal purchase information may be linked to the Personal Information you provide to us (typically limited to your email address, as stated above). 
          Stripe does not supply us with any of your other Personal Information such as your name, street address, or credit card information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Managing personal information</h2>


        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          You are able to update your Personal Information in your "Account Settings" on the Website. Currently this is limited to just your email address, as described above.
          You may also request that we delete your email address, but this will prevent you from accessing the products you have purchased from Flooq.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          When you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
          Some information may remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your account for a retention period.
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your information cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
          We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Use and processing of collected information</h2>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our Website; improve customer service; process transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; and operate our Website.
          Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage.
          This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
        </p>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: 
          (i) You have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. 
          This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; 
          (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; 
          (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; 
          (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; 
          (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, 
          and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Information transfer and storage</h2>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own.
          You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law
          or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.
          If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the Contact section.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">The rights of users</h2>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: 
          (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; 
          (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; 
          (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; 
          (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; 
          (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; 
          (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; 
          (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible,
          to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent,
          on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">The right to object to processing</h2>

        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, 
          you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. 
          You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, 
          you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. 
          To learn whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">How to exercise these rights</h2>
        
        <p className="my-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner by email at <a className="text-blue-500" href="mailto:info@flooq.io">info@flooq.io</a>. 
          These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.

          We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, 
          use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, 
          use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. 
          However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. 
          Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that
